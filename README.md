- üí° Inspiration **We were inspired by the idea of how Kahoot works as a platform where you test your knowledge generally, so we thought of adding a coding theme to the project by combining Kahoot and Codeforces (It is a platform where you compete against other programmers by solving problems by coding). We also wanted to enhance the Computer Science teaching techniques in education.**

- üìä Challenges we ran into [It took us a lot of research to make the communication and synchronization between webpages and each other. Making the text-box acting as a compiler, so you can write proper code.](It took us a lot of research to make the communication and synchronization between webpages and each other.

- ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next for Code Colosseum [Have individual use of feedback by the help of AI as a mentor.](Have individual use of feedback by the help of AI as a mentor.)

- üßæ What it does **We have built a web app which you are given random problem questions about coding, and you have to answer the question by typing in a coding syntax.**

- ‚öíÔ∏è How we built it **We used HTML, CSS, Java Script for the webpages, we implemented Sockets and Flask libraries in Python as a backend for the webpages, where hosting a local network goes and communicating with the webpages and each other.**
